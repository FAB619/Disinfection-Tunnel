# What?
<hr />
According to recent studies on the causes of Covid-19 contamination, the medical setting is one of the primary factors. **ENIM decontamination Tunnel** will allow a total disinfection of the medical environment and patients at the entrance/exit of hospitals.


# Why?
<hr />

Sanitary and decontamination Tunnels and Gates represent a **safe protection and entry** for everyone, in particular for those who work in close contact with groups and are therefore at higher risk. It can be installed at the entrance of public ofﬁces, pharmacies, supermarkets, airports, hospitals, ports, stations. It is suitable for all private companies who need to sanitise the workforce, goods, vehicles and materials. It helps to **prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19)**

The process used is misting (disinfecting without wetting) will allow a total decontamination thanks to the channel length 1, 5 and the 3 rows of disinfectant nozzles. The solution used is provided by the safety and hygiene unit of the **Tunisian Ministry of Health, Sousse district, which are partners of ATM/ENIM on this project.**
The Tunnel will be equipped with **a thermal camera and will automatically take people's body temperature**. An **audible signal** will be emitted if the person's temperature exceeds the set value.
